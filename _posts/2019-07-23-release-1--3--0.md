[Click here to download](https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/examples/examples-1.3.0.zip).

If you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

Before getting to the release itself, a few project announcements:

First, ***the next release will be the last release to support Python 2***.
After that, starting with Bokeh 2.0, Python 3.5 will be the minimum supported Python version.
We will publish a blog post soon outlining all expected Bokeh 2.0 changes.

Earlier this month, Bokeh passed [10k stars on GitHub](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) and is
about to pass [10k followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BokehPlots). Thanks to everyone
for your support and interest!

The Bokeh project has assumed direct control over the CDN that publishes BokehJS
resources. This includes making a new base URL of ``cdn.``***``bokeh``***``.org`` the primary
location going forward. All existing links to ``cdn.pydata.org`` will continue
to function indefinitely, but users are encouraged to use the new URL
starting immediately.

As a reminder, the Bokeh project has recently launched two new sites:

* A new project front page at [bokeh.org](https://bokeh.org)
* An improved support forum at [discourse.bokeh.org](https://discourse.bokeh.org)

Both these sites are great resources for new and old users, please use and share
them often!

We have also created a [Project Bokeh](ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/20282761/)
page on LinkedIn. Anyone who has contributed to Bokeh may now list Bokeh on their
own profile.
There is not much content there yet, but we hope to ramp things up in the coming
months.

As part of all this increased emphasis on outreach, we have had a sharp new logotype
produced:

<center>
<img src="https://static.bokeh.org/logos/logotype.svg" height="30" /><p />
</center>

Please feel free to use this anytime you are sharing or writing about Bokeh.

Finally, ***the July Fundraiser is still ongoing!*** Although we have just recently met
our original goal of 1000 USD, every bit helps offset operational costs (e.g. to
keep the CDN running), so please donate if you can, or help spread the word:

<center>
<a href="https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/bokeh-july-fundraiser/index.html">
<b><h3>Click to Donate to the Bokeh Project</h3></b>
</a><p />
</center>

THANK YOU to everyone who donates to Bokeh! We will make a wrap-up blog post about the
July fundraising experience in the near future.

Now, on to new features!

### New File Input Widget

Another old issue falls! With some inspiration from an existing [Holoviews](https://holoviews.org)
implementation, [**``#6096``** File Open Dialog](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6096) was
added. Some follow-on work by new contributor [jbeanland](https://github.com/jbeanland) helped
improve and refine the initial version.
Choose a file below, and watch the results update:

<div id="file-input" width="100%"></div>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-3-0/file-input.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "file-input"); })
</script>

The ``FileInput`` can be configured with the standard HTML [``"accept"`` attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_accept.asp),
and reports back the base filename, mime type, and base64-encoded file contents:

```python
file_input = FileInput(accept=".csv,.json,.txt")

callback = CustomJS(args=dict(para=para, file_input=file_input), code="""
    para.text = "<p><b>filename:</b> " + file_input.filename  + \
                "<p><b>number of lines:</b> " + atob(file_input.value).split('\\n').length
""")

file_input.js_on_change('value', callback)
```

&nbsp;

### Data Cube Widget for Aggregation

Recent new contrubutor [jburgy](https://github.com/jburgy) really knocked it out of the
park with sizeable PR to implement [**``#8100``** Option to collapse DataRable rows](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8100). The final result was actually an entirely new widget,
``DataCube``. Consider that you are starting with data like this:

```python
source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(
    d0=['A', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'J', 'L', 'M'],
    d1=['B', 'D', 'D', 'H', 'K', 'L', 'N'],
    d2=['C', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'K', 'L', 'O'],
    px=[10,  20,  30,  40,  50,  60,  70 ],
))
```

Then the ``DataCube`` can produce a table with nested groupings or sub-groupings that
you specify. It can evenly automatically aggregate those groups if you
choose. Here is a ``DataCube`` based on the data above:

&nbsp;

<center>
<div id="data-cube"></div>
</center>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-3-0/data-cube.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "data-cube"); })
</script>

&nbsp;

The code for the above example looks like this:

```python
target = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(row_indices=[], labels=[]))

formatter = StringFormatter(font_style='bold')

columns = [
    TableColumn(field='d2', title='Name', width=40, sortable=False, formatter=formatter),
    TableColumn(field='px', title='Price', width=40, sortable=False),
]

grouping = [
    GroupingInfo(getter='d0', aggregators=[SumAggregator(field_='px')]),
    GroupingInfo(getter='d1', aggregators=[SumAggregator(field_='px')])
]

cube = DataCube(source=source, columns=columns, grouping=grouping, target=target)
```

### Hover Highlight for Stacked Glyphs

The previous release saw the addition of some really useful new methods for stacking
aligned areas. But a feature was missing: they did not work with a hover highlight!
That deficiency has been corrected and now stacked areas can be hovered just like any
other glyph:

```python
p.varea_stack(names, x='index', source=df, color=brewer['Oranges'][N],
              hover_alpha=1.0, hover_color=brewer['Blues'][N])
```

<center>
<div id="stacked-hover-highlight"></div>
</center>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-3-0/stacked-hover-highlight.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "stacked-hover-highlight"); })
</script>

&nbsp;

### Fine-Grained Text Input

Last, but not least, *another* new contributor [russellburdt](https://github.com/russellburdt)
dropped in to add some additional capability to the existing ``TextInput`` widget.
Now not only can you get the ``value`` when a user hits *``<enter>``*, you can also get
``value_input`` which is updated on every keystroke:

<div id="text-input"></div>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-3-0/text-input.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "text-input"); })
</script>
