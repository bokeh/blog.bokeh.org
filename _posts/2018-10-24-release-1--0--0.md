#### What 1.0 Means

First off, what "1.0" does *not* mean: It does not mean that all the work is done,
or that all bugs are squashed.
For instance, there are still a fair number of known issues with the built-in
layout system. A large [Work In Progress PR](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/8085)
will fix many of these issues in a future 1.1 release. Additionally, you can see
larger "roadmap" items still TBD in the new
[Vision and Work](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/vision.html) section
of the docs.

But these things will be done in a way compatible with current APIs. After a period of
youthful "0.x" experimentation, the
[Core Team](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/wiki/BEP-4:-Project-Roles#core-team)
asserts that existing public APIs will now be defended. (\*) From now on, any
intentional breaking changes will precipitate a major version bump.
Of course we will strive to avoid any *unintentional* changes as well&mdash;see the section
below on improved testing. This commitment is the major purpose of releasing "1.0" now.

This milestone also represents the progress of making Bokeh
a truly independent project in the context of a wider OSS community.
However, to secure long-term success, the Bokeh project must diversify both its
contributor base and its funding sources. So if you or your organization find Bokeh
valuable, please consider making a concrete contribution towards sustaining the project.
This could be by [making a financial donation through NumFOCUS](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/MzE5NjE=)
or by [getting involved with development](https://gitter.im/bokeh/bokeh-dev).

Long story short: right now marks a *fantastic* time to get more involved.

<small>
(\*) This applies without qualification to all public *Python* APIs. The public/private distinction for
BohehJS is still somewhat murky. Our specific committment around BokehJS is this:

**Any and all usage in
currently published "CustomJS" or custom extension examples will continue to function without change,
and synchronizable
BokehJS models and events (e.g. "ColumnDataSource" or "Tap"), will not be removed or have their existing properties modified.**.

In order to make improvements and bug fixes, we will continue to use
discretion regarding any changes in other, low level BokehJS code that is not intended for general users, and we will work to make these BokehJS API boundaries more clear
as time goes on.
</small>

#### Community

Before getting to the technical details of this release, I wanted to take a moment
to recognize some stats about our community:

* The [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/bokeh) has more than **1000** members
* [@BokehPlots](https://twitter.com/bokehplots) has over **8000** followers
* The number of [GitHub stars](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) just hit **8300**
* Combined conda+pip installs regularly exceed **600k/month** (!)
* The docs site has **55-60k** unique monthly visitors.

Any one of these facts is humbling, but the current success of Bokeh is owed to the
work of very many contributors. Please be sure to read all the way to the end,
and the full "Thank You" section below.

#### Patches With Holes

Thanks to the efforts of Julia Signell, old issue [`#2321` - Patches with Holes](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/2321)
has been completed. The approach taken was to add a new glyph type `MultiPolygons`
that is inspired heavily by GeoJSON format of sub-polygons that specify an
"exterior ring" followed by optional "holes" inside the exterior ring. (This approach
was also inspired by earlier work by Sarah Bird.)
Using this glyph from the `bokeh.plotting` API looks like:

```python
p.multi_polygons(
    xs=[

        # first multi-polygon (blue)
        [[ [1, 1, 2, 2],
           [1.2, 1.6, 1.6],
           [1.8, 1.8, 1.6]], # sub-polygon with 2 holes

         [ [3, 3, 4] ], # sub-polygon with no holes

        # second multi-polygon (red)
        [[ [1, 2, 2, 1],
           [1.3, 1.3, 1.7, 1.7] ]], # sub-polygon with 1 hole
    ],
    ys=[
        [[ [4, 3, 3, 4], [3.2, 3.2, 3.6], [3.4, 3.8, 3.8] ], [ [1, 3, 1] ]],
        [[ [1, 1, 2, 2], [1.3, 1.7, 1.7, 1.3] ]]],
    color=['navy', 'crimson'])
```

The resulting output has two multi-polygons, some with holes and some without:

![Image of MultiPolygon](/images/release-1-0-0/mpgon.png){:width="60%"}

These "patches with holes" are often useful for working with GIS data or maps,
and support all the usual and expected hover and hit-testing interactions. In
the future, we plan to add more convenience methods to integrate directly with
GeoJSON sources.

Another use case is filled contour plots. Although it currently takes some
effort to create the necessary coordinates from single iso-lines, it is possible
to generate filled contour plots for the first time:

![Image of contour plot](/images/release-1-0-0/contour.png){:width="56%"}

As resources permit, we also plan to add methods to make generating
filled contours plots simpler. (This would also
make a great self-contained project for an interested new contributor!)

#### A New Scatter

Another old issue [`#5884` - Let Scatter marker type be parameterizable](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5884)
made it into the 1.0 release. Now the `scatter` glyph method creates a new `Scatter`
object, that can specify the marker type of each data point individually:

```python
plot.scatter(x=[1,2,3], y=[4,5,6], marker=['circle', 'hex', 'square'])
```

This capability is especially useful together with a new `factor_marker` transform
that can map categorical values to marker types:

```python
SPECIES = ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']
MARKERS = ['circle', 'diamond', 'triangle']

p = figure(title = "Iris Morphology")

p.scatter("petal_length", "petal_width", source=flowers, legend="species",
          fill_alpha=0.4, size=12,
          marker=factor_marker('species', MARKERS, SPECIES)
          color=factor_cmap('species', 'Category10_3', SPECIES))

```

![Image of Scatter markers](/images/release-1-0-0/markers.png){:width="60%"}

This approach with a parameterized scatter is useful whenever you want to
keep all the data inside a single `ColumnDataSource`.

#### JSON Export and Embed

Bokeh 1.0 adds a new function to `bokeh.embed`:

```python
json_item(obj)
```

This function can be called on any Bokeh object, e.g plots or layouts, and the
output of the call is a block of JSON that represents a Bokeh Document for `obj`.
(You might also note that Bokeh now uses "simple" IDs by default):

```
{'target_id': None,
 'root_id': '1002',
 'doc': {'roots': {
   'references': [
      {'type': 'PanTool',     'id': '1022', 'attributes': {}},
      {'type': 'BasicTicker', 'id': '1013', 'attributes': {}},
      {'type': 'LinearAxis',  'id': '1017', 'attributes': {
        'axis_label': 'petal_length',
        'formatter': {'id': '1043', 'type': 'BasicTickFormatter'},
        'plot': {'id': '1002', 'subtype': 'Figure', 'type': 'Plot'},
        'ticker': {'id': '1018', 'type': 'BasicTicker'}}},
      {'type': 'DataRange1d', 'id': '1004', 'attributes': {'callback': None}},
      {'type': 'Circle',      'id': '1038', 'attributes': {'fill_alpha': {'value': 0.2},
        'fill_color': {'field': 'fill_color'},
        'line_color': {'field': 'line_color'},
        'size': {'units': 'screen', 'value': 10}
        'x': {'field': 'x'},
        'y': {'field': 'y'}}},

      ...

      {'type': 'BoxZoomTool', 'id': '1024', 'attributes': {
        'overlay': {'id': '1030', 'type': 'BoxAnnotation'}}}
    ],
   'root_ids': ['1002']},
  'title': '',
  'version': '1.0.0'}}
```

Now you can use this JSON output in any HTML document by calling a single
function from JavaScript: `Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "myplot")`
The first parameter is the JSON output and the second parameter is the `id` of
the div to embed the content into. (It's also possible to specify the id on the
Python side instead if that is preferable.)

As a concrete example, if you have a Flask application that serves Bokeh
JSON at an endpoint `/plot` like this:

```python

from bokeh.embed import json_item

@app.route('/plot')
def plot2():
    p = make_plot('sepal_width', 'sepal_length')
    return json.dumps(json_item(p))
```

That content can be embedded from a `fetch` call in the page template like this:

```html
<body>
  <div id="myplot"></div>

  <script>
  fetch('/plot')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "myplot"); })
  </script>
</body>
```


#### Testing, Testing...

Thanks to a few Pull Requests from recent new contributor [xavArtley](https://github.com/xavArtley),
Bokeh unit tests now run continously on Windows for the first time ever:

![Image of Appveyor](/images/release-1-0-0/appveyor.png){:width="70%"}

Another development concerns rigorous UI testing.
Sometime in 2017 our previous Selenium integration testing infrastructure fell into
disrepair. As a result unfortunate regressions and bugs started to slip past
our review. I am happy to report that an important goal for 1.0 has been acheived,
and our Selenium integration testing machinery has been re-built from the ground
up, as well as greatly expanded. Where we previously only had roughly a dozen UI tests, now
[almost 200 Selenium tests](https://travis-ci.org/bokeh/bokeh/jobs/445250958)
run continously to explicitly exercise various Bokeh features and
behaviors:

![Image of Selenium tests](/images/release-1-0-0/selenium.png){:width="75%"}

These are both very important improvements to our testing capability that will
help us to ensure stability in 1.x releases. Still, they are only
the beginning. With the new infrastructure it is easier than ever to add these
kinds of tests, and we plan to do just that!

#### Examples Refresh

Leading up to this release we also tried to make a pass over all the examples in
the documentation. There are several hundred examples available now, and many
were in need of some gentle attention. All examples were reviewed to improve their
visual style, and to make them reflect current best practices.

Additionally, some new examples were added. One worth mentioning in particular
is a face dectection demo written by Luke Canavan. Here it is, identifying me (but not our dog):

![Image of faces example](/images/release-1-0-0/faces.gif){:width="70%"}

This is a nice example because it ties together several great Bokeh features, all
in under 80 lines of Python code.

* Demonstrates data updates and streaming API
* Connects web visualization to PyData tools (OpenCV)
* Uses custom template for nice look and responsive layout

This example is located at in the GitHub repository under [*examples/app/faces*](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/1.0.0/examples/app/faces).
To run it, you will need OpenCV and the latest [Bokeh sample data](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html#sample-data)
installed.
