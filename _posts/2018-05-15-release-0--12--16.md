[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

#### Hover Tooltips for images

With the "Selection Refactor" from the last release over with, it was possible to add
hover tooltips for images, an often requested feature!

<center>
<script
    src="/js/release-0-12-16/image_hover.js"
    id="da2641c1-f7f1-4a5b-bd75-51c4ea7c2e53"
    data-bokeh-model-id="c264ce51-d6d6-44f7-a361-2b500db51f64"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="3d833a24-599c-4e15-9147-d001704fd0ce"
></script>
</center>

This example was as simple as:

```python
p.add_tools(HoverTool(tooltips=[("x", "$x"), ("y", "$y"), ("value", "@image")]))
```

You can find more information and details about the various different ways to add image
hovers [in the User's Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.16/docs/user_guide/tools.html#image-hover)

#### CustomJS for Hover tooltips

Another new hover feature is [`CustomJSHover`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.16/docs/reference/models/tools.html#bokeh.models.tools.CustomJSHover), which allows users to completely customize the
information presented in a hover tooltip. For example, if you hover over the blue dot on the
map below you can see the latitude and lonitude printed out, instead of the underlying web mercator coords:

<center>
<script
    src="/js/release-0-12-16/custom_hover.js"
    id="b6b13167-178c-48fc-8aad-c99c73335f1c"
    data-bokeh-model-id="934cb3b4-6c45-45c5-802d-09bc394d2b19"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="9ab3d7a6-1149-41a1-90fd-55130f60a5d1"
></script>
</center>

This used code that looks like:

```python
code = """
    var projections = require("core/util/projections");
    var x = special_vars.x
    var y = special_vars.y
    var coords = projections.wgs84_mercator.inverse([x, y])
    return "" + coords[%d]
"""

p.add_tools(HoverTool(
    tooltips=[
        ( 'lon',   '@x{custom}' ),
        ( 'lat',   '@y{custom}' ),
    ],

    formatters={
        'x' : CustomJSHover(formatter=code % 0),
        'y' : CustomJSHover(formatter=code % 1),
    }
))
```

For users doing GIS related work, HoloViews and GeoViews will wrap this capability up
even more neatly.

It's worth noting that `CustomJSHover` gets all of the hovered indices, so it's
possible in principle to do simple aggregations or other summarizations. For full details
[see the Reference Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.16/docs/reference/models/tools.html#bokeh.models.tools.CustomJSHover)

#### Arbitrary Axes locations

For various reasons, sometimes issues take a very long time. I am happy to report that one
the oldest open issues [`#113` - Axis should have option to have a fixed orientation](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/113`)
has been completeted. Now, you can configure the `fixed_location` property of an axis to fix
that axis at that location inside the plot:

![Image of arbitrary axis location](/images/release-0-12-16/axes.png){:width="80%"}

#### Upcoming Work

As mentioned in previously, we are reaching a point of relative stability with
respect to Bokeh development. The major tasks for the next few Bokeh releases are
these:

* Allow Bokeh app components to be individually included in arbitrary HTML templates
* Finish the work to clearly delineate and standardize all modules and APIs

In addition to this, we hope to accomplish as much bug fixing, polishing, and documentation
as possible in the coming few months.
