We are pleased to announce the release of Bokeh 0.12.14!

This incremental release has the following highlights:

* New multi-gesture tools for editing glyphs directly
* Update for compatibility with upcoming Tornado 5.0

Plus several other bug fixes and documentation improvements.
For full details, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
and [Release Notes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.14/docs/releases/0.12.14.html).
Additionally, examples for each release are uploaded to CDN.

If you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

#### Edit tools

Thanks to Philipp Rudiger, this release sees the addition of some neat new tools that have been
asked about for some time. Specifically users have wanted the ability to edit glyph positions and
shapes, and have those changes reflected in the underlying data source. This releases sees four
initial tools, including a Point Edit Tool:

As well as a Polygon Edit tool:

There are also tools for editing boxes as well as drawing new polygons and lines. See the new
[Edit Tools](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/dev/docs/user_guide/tools.html#edit-tools) section
of the User's Guide for full details and live examples to try out.

#### Upcoming Work

As mentioned in the previous release, we are reaching a point of relative stability
with respect to Bokeh development. The major tasks for the next few Bokeh releases
are these:

* Complete migration of BokehJS to TypeScript
* Allow Bokeh application components to be individually included in arbitrary HTML templates
* Refactor and improve how selections are handled for data sources
* Finish the work to clearly delineate and standardize all modules and APIs

With the exception of the work on selections, I do not expect any major user-facing changes.
The selection architecture has badly needed an overhaul for a long time. Now that we have
resources to dive into it, it must be done before 1.0 since there may be some unavoidable
breaking changes necessary in some situations. (We will strive to keep these to a bare minimum and
provide compatibility where possible.) Any changes will be thoroughly documented in future
releases.
