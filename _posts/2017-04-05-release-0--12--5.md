* Themes now work with ``components`` and in Jupyter notebooks
* New glyphs can be added to running Bokeh server applications
* A Community Code of Conduct has been adopted

As well as many other small bugfixes and docs additions.
For full details, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
and [Release Notes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/releases/0.12.5.html).

As a reminder, we now package and upload examples for each Bokeh release
to our CDN. [Click here to download](https://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/examples/examples-0.12.5.zip).

This release can most easily be installed from the Bokeh channel on
[Anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/bryanv/dashboard) by executing the
command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` if you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) or ``pip install bokeh``
otherwise.

There are several great fixes, improvements, and features to show off
below. But first I should get one important announcement out of the way.
Sometimes there are things that we might like to do, but must ultimately
admit that we do not have the ability to do. This is one of those instances:

<center><h5><b>Support for Matplotlib compatibility is deprecated.</b></h5></center>

The Bokeh team unfortunately does not have the resources to continue
supporting this functionality in its current form. It was always *extremely*
limited in the first place, and often produced substandard results. In order
to support the long term health of the Bokeh project, all MPL compatibility
support will be removed on the occasion of a 1.0 release. Any code that
currently uses ``to_bokeh`` will continue to work with a deprecation warning
until that time.

#### Improvements to Google Maps plots

For quite some time there have been a number of lingering issues with using
``GMapPlot``. Not all of them were "big" on their own, but they could add up
to some severe usability problems. I am happy to report that a major pass was
made over this corner of Bokeh:

[#2822&mdash;GMapPlot Resets to (0, 0)](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/2822)

[#2940&mdash;GMapPlot Coordinate Axes](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/2940)

[#3737&mdash;GMapPlot doesn't display anything in Jupyter v.4](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/3737)

[#4835&mdash;Multiple GMap plots whiting out  in notebook. ](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/4835)

[#5592&mdash;GMapOptions are not dynamically applied](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5592)

[#5801&mdash;GMap underflowing Bokeh figured](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5801)

[#5826&mdash;Add bokeh.plotting.gmap to create GMapPlot correctly and easily](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5826)

[#5845&mdash;add support for GMap scale control](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5845)

In particular, it's now easier than ever to create Google Maps plots.
Previously, map plots required writing a
[fair chunk of code](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/models/file/maps.py)
using the low level `bokeh.models` API. But now all it takes is one call
to the new `bokeh.plotting.gmap` function:

```python
map_options = GMapOptions(lat=30.2861, lng=-97.7394, map_type="roadmap", zoom=13)

plot = gmap("GOOGLE_API_KEY", map_options)

show(plot)
```

When you create map plots this way, they will automatically be configured
with the new axes that display human-friendly latitude and longitude values.
Additionally, now map options like map styles can be updated dynamically.

The example plot below expands on this snippet to demonstrate more of the
fixes and features in the list:

<div>
<center>
<script
    src="/js/release-0-12-5/gmap.js"
    id="5722c96b-e8f5-4ec4-b21a-e19ae5d13fac"
    data-bokeh-model-id="f699ff86-1019-4e91-a73f-fa27b2d5fcf4"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="7c7e29bc-2997-4bbb-b53f-193f0171556d"
></script>
</center>
</div>

#### Interactive Legends for Hiding Glyphs

One long-requested feature has been to have interactive legends that users
could click on to hide, or possibly mute the corresponding glyphs. That has
been added in this release. To have the legend completely hide glyphs, set
the `click_policy` to hide:

```python
plot.legend.click_policy = "hide"
```

You can also set the policy to mute the associate glyph in some way.
Typically in this case you'll want to configure the parameters such as
`muted_line_alpha` to control exactly how the muted glyph appear:

```python
plot.line(x='x', y='y', source=source, legend="Stuff", muted_line_alpha=0.1)
plot.legend.click_policy = "mute"
```

You can see these interactive legend in action in the plot example
for the next section.

#### Custom Client Side Data Transformations

```python
v_func = """\
    var first = xs[0]
    var norm = new Float64Array(xs.length)
    for (i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) { norm[i] = xs[i] / first }
    return norm
"""

normalize = CustomJSTransform(func="", v_func=v_func)

plot.line(x='date', y=dict(field='close', transform=normalize), source=aapl_source)
```

<div>
<script
    src="/js/release-0-12-5/transform.js"
    id="70195796-0dc7-4eb0-bf98-4ba75f0b6028"
    data-bokeh-model-id="18b2f400-3489-4722-8c75-29ec3c2d05f3"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="18eb47e2-444d-47c6-a200-a0dee4294713"
></script>
</div>

Oh, and be sure to click on the legend to mute the visibility of the
different series!


#### JS and Python Callbacks for General UI Events

Another often-requested feature has been a way to respond to events in a more
fine-grained way. I am happy to say that JS and Python callbacks are now
possible on many different kinds of events: low level mouse and wheel actions,
higher level pan, tap and button click actions, as well as responding to
the start and stop of "Level of Detail" mode:

![Image of events](/images/release-0-12-5/events.gif){:width="80%"}

More events are planned for future releases. You can see how these events are
used with `CustomJS` callbacks in this snippet:

```python
s = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[], y=[]))

p.circle('x', 'y', color='c', size=20, alpha=0.4, source=s)

p.js_on_event(Tap, CustomJS(args=dict(s=s1), code="""
    event = cb_obj;
    s.data.x.push(event.x)
    s.data.y.push(event.y)
    s.trigger('change')
"""))
```

The example below uses this code and some additional callbacks for pan and
double tap events to create a simple drawing canvas:

<div>
<center>
<script
    src="/js/release-0-12-5/events.js"
    id="6da0290f-39bf-4f28-a0af-7f585f9ebc95"
    data-bokeh-model-id="678c8a8a-426a-44a6-b1fc-7bfca503a19f"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="9dc36987-699b-40db-b61e-deeb6102b946"
></script>
</center>
</div>

These examples show how to use these new events with `CustomJS`
callbacks that run in the browser. But they work just as well in Bokeh
server apps as well. Just use the `on_event` method instead of `js_on_event`.
Of course, Bokeh is extensible, so it's possible to define your own
custom events as well.

#### Bokeh Server Options Simplified

The --host parameter to the Bokeh Server CLI was a common source of confusion.
Recent changes to the Bokeh server have rendered it no longer necessary, so it
is now deprecated. In order not to break existing deployments, the parameter
is still accepted, but will be ignored. If you are embedding a Bokeh server
application in a page that has a different public URL than the Bokeh server,
you will want to supply the --allow-websockets-origin parameter to allow
connections originating from the public URL.

#### Bokeh Apps Fully Support in Jupyter Notebooks

The previous Proof-of-Concept demonstrated for embedding Bokeh applications
Jupyter notebooks that was demonstrated inthe `0.12.4` release has been
fully fleshed out. It's now easy to create and show Bokeh applications
directly inline in Jupyter notebooks, using the same `show` function that
is used for standalone Bokeh plots:

![Image of notebook app](/images/release-0-12-5/notebook.gif){:width="80%"}

You can find the notebook above [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/0.12.5/examples/howto/server_embed/notebook_embed.ipynb).

#### Code of Conduct Adopted

With the help of input from several people,
[BEP 3: Community Code](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/wiki/BEP-3:-Community-Code)
has been implemented. This is an important and required step in order to
pursue [NumFocus Fiscal Sponsorship](http://www.numfocus.org/information-on-fiscal-sponsorship.html).

The details can be found in the link, but as mentioned there, the Bokeh
community has been fantastic since day one, and a one-line summary of the
CoC is simply a reflection of the community values already on display:

> Please be always kind and courteous. There's never a need to be mean or rude or disrespectful.

#### What's Next?

One of the focus areas for the next
[0.12.6 release](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/milestone/30) is to clean
up and refactor the layout system to make it more robust, maintainable, and
performant. Additionally, we plan to clean up the handling of categorical
data as well as support nested coordinate systems.

We hope to make 0.12.6 a smaller milestone with a shorter release cycle.

One other important announcement for `0.12.6`: *the `bokeh.charts` API will
be moved into a separate GitHub project.* The new project will be called
`bkcharts`. For now, Bokeh will depend on the new `bkcharts` package,
and import its contents automatically. All existing code will work with a
warning message until the 1.0 release, when the dependency will be dropped
and `bkcharts` charts will have to be explicitly installed to be used.

Finally, while I can't make definite statements about timelines, I can
say that resources have been allocated specifically to work on all the
following important tasks:

* Programmatic static image (PNG) generation using Selenium
* Large graph support in [Datashader](http://datashader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) / Small graph support in Bokeh
* Core improvements to support the [RBokeh](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/) project
