The Bokeh Core Team is incredibly grateful for each of our 322 [total contributors](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/graphs/contributors) and their efforts
in making Bokeh such an amazing project and community. As a small token of our appreciation, we've
made special "pre-1.0 contributor" laptop stickers for users who have made a PR to the Bokeh project
or related subprojects in our GitHub organization.

If you're one of these people, please [submit this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vVL-fbk4wgkzTw9N5ywNBgUqyGIGsho53EpZHSs2vYk/) with your
information by December 31st, and we'll mail you the sticker.

Thanks,

Luke Canavan
