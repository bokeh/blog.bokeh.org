**We are pleased to announce the release of Bokeh 1.1!**

The major topic for this release was improving Bokeh's layout capability. [More than 50 layout related issues were closed](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.1+label%3A%22tag%3A+layout%22)! In addition to the layout overhaul, many other small bugfixes and features went into this release. Some highlights:

* Hover tool fixes and features [`#8742`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8742), [`#8668`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8668), [`#7991`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/7991)

If you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

### Layout Overhaul

One of the last major areas Bokeh has needed improvement in is its layout system.
For several years, Bokeh used a constraint solver to compute the layout
positions of plots, axes, widgets, etc. The constraint-based approach initially
promised to afford a very sophisticated layout capability with a very general
approach across the library. Ultimately, it suffered from many intrinsic
practical issues, some of which are discussed below.

Bokeh 1.1 contains a major overhaul of the layout system by Mateusz Paprocki
that removes the constraint-based approach entirely, in favor of a simpler,
more predictable, more testable alogrithm. All of this brings many benefits,
as well as dozens of fixed issues.

##### Layout Performance

While we hadn't originally imagined users putting many dozens or hundreds of
plots on a single page, it is a topic that has been raised several times over
the years. Unfortunately a major drawback with the constraint-based approach to
layout is that its scaling behavior made these kinds of use-cases impossibly
slow. The 60-plot test case in
[`#6294`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6294)
took nearly <b>40 seconds(!)</b> to load.


With this work, layout computation (even for large cases) typically takes only
a few milliseconds. The test case in the issue above now loads in under one
second. I'm happy to report that even pages with hundreds of plots are now
possible:

![Image of large grid plot](/images/release-1-1-0/large-grid.png){:width="60%"}

To see the full 260 plots load in ~2 seconds, <a href="https://blog.bokeh.org/static/release-1-1-0/large-grid.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.

As part of this work some excessive over-rendering was also cleaned up, leading
to improvements in other areas, such as
[`DataTable` performance](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8227).
In general Bokeh should seem snappier across the board with this release.

##### Sizing Modes

Another drawback of the constraint-based approach was that it was hard to
develop features around. It had some nice qualities for the simplest cases,
but made even slightly more complicated situations more difficult than they
needed to be. As a result, several of the sizing modes we had imagined having
available were either broken, or not implemented fully. I am happy to report
that all the sizing modes such as `"stretch_both"` and `"scale_width"` are
now implemented fully:

![Animated image of large sizing modes](/images/release-1-1-0/sizing-mode.gif){:width="70%"}{:.shadow}


##### Testing Improvements

A final drawback to the constraint-based approach is that it was difficult to
debug and maintain. When things went wrong, there was very little actionable
information available. Beyond that, it was difficult to create tests that
thoroughly exercised layout. As a result it was far too easy to make code
updates that left undetected and unintentional changes.

As part of this work, a very large suite of "baseline" tests that record exact
pixel dimensions of layouts was added. These tests cover *all* of our examples
and documentation, as well as many purpose-written scripts that exercise very
specific layout situations. The layout record is a simple text format that can
be quickly and easily diffed in unit tests.

Although there are no exciting images or plots in this section, this is
probably one of the most important outcomes of the "Big Layout Refector".
With this new testing infrastructure in place, we can be certain that if there
are changes to make in the future, they will be considered and intentional.

This work marks the largest update since Bokeh 1.0. We made a strong
effort to ensure no APIs or behaviors changed in incompatible ways. But with
limited resources, it's possible things slipped by. <b>Please raise GitHub issues
if any problems arise.</b> If you'd like to help increase the testing that Bokeh
receives, for the benefit of all users, please reach out.

### Two New Widgets

Two new widgets were added in Bokeh 1.1: a numeric input with configurable
step size, and a color selector. Use the widgets to change the color
and size of the scatter markers below:

&nbsp;

<center>
<div id="two-new-widgets-plot"></div>
</center>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-1-0/two-new-widgets.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "two-new-widgets-plot"); })
</script>

Note that the color selector is currently browser dependent. Some browsers
show a sophisticated color picker, others display a simple hex color input.
Integrating a third party color picker that is consistent across platforms
would make a great task for anyone looking to get involved in Bokeh core
development.

### RGBA Image Hover

Some time ago, hover tool capabilities were added to the colormapped `Image`
glyph. For uninteresting reasons, the same capability was not added to the
`ImageRGBA` glyph at that time. However, with this release, it is now possible
to have hover tooltips on RGBA images:

&nbsp;

<center>
<div id="image-rgba-hover"></div>
</center>

<script>
  fetch('/static/release-1-1-0/image-rgba-hover.json')
    .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
    .then(function(item) { Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, "image-rgba-hover"); })
</script>

In this case we used a `CustomJSHover` to format the color channels:

```python
code = """
const r = (value >> 0 ) & 255
const g = (value >> 8 ) & 255
const b = (value >> 16) & 255
return `(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
"""

HoverTool(
    tooltips=[
        ( '(x, y)',  '$x, $y'         ),
        ( '(r,g,b)', '@image{custom}' ),
    ],
    formatters={ 'image' : CustomJSHover(code=code) }
)
```

### Call to Action

With my departure from Anaconda, the development on Bokeh enters a new, more
leisurely phase. Happily, most of the heavy lifting has been accomplished.
But there is still ongoing work to do, and now marks a time when there is
opportunity for anyone to make a big positive impact. Here  are some ways
you can help the entire Bokeh community:

##### Donate financially

Bokeh relies on paid cloud infrastucture to host the CDN files for BokehJS,
serve the documentation and demos, and store CI build artifacts. [Your contribution
to NumFocus helps defray those costs](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-bokeh/index.html).

##### Become a new contributor

With fewer people paid to work on Bokeh, it's more important than ever for new
contributors to step up. Code contributions are always welcome, but there are
actually other areas that the project team lacks depth, where new people with
a little experience could make a huge difference:

* Cloud infra management (AWS and Azure) to streamline operations
* Web and graphic design to improve the docs, demo, and sharing sites
* Technical writing to improve the Information Architecture of the docs
* Front-end dev to help make BokehJS a real JS library on its own
* Selenium testing to increase reliability and stability across releases
* SEO and site analytics to help understand and improve our web properties

##### Offer support help

This is really another form of contribution, but it's worth drawing out
explicitly. There is a great combined wealth of knowledge about Bokeh in the
community. If many people make a *small effort* to help others on the mailing
list and Stack Overflow, then everyone benefits and no one has to shoulder
too much burden. Please consider sharing your valuable knowledge with other
users. To help make things easier, we hope to move Bokeh community support to
a Discourse instance later this year.
