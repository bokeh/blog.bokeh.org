Hot on the heels of the last version, we are pleased to announce the release of Bokeh 0.12.9!

This update includes the following important new features:

* Integration with JupyterLab
* A much faster binary transport option for arrays

This release also contains several bugfixes and docs additions.
For full details, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
and [Release Notes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.9/docs/releases/0.12.9.html).
Additionally, examples for each release are uploaded to CDN.

If you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

-----

First a quick note. You may have noticed that this announcement is not for 0.12.8
as expected. Last night, about 10 minutes after the release build finished,
a [showstopper issue was discovered](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6922).
A "re-release" was attempted but was not possible. So here we are, early, at 0.12.9!

This problem was caught by the extremely astute and eager user
[@Pierretherenard](https://github.com/pierretherenard). I very much appreciate their
help late last night to resolve things, and
also want stress: if you are an active Bokeh user, **please always help us test by installing
and trying out [dev builds and release candidates](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html#developer-builds).** The more eyes there are on things, the
more likely issues can be caught earlier, and that is better for everyone.

Now on to the fun bits!

-----

#### JupyterLab Integration

In case you missed it, the first ever [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) was recently held in New York. One of the big topics of discussion there
was [JupyerLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), which is the next generation
of the Jupyter UI. JupyterLab is a robust and extensible framework that includes a new
Notebook component, built from the ground up.

[Luke Canavan](https://github.com/canavandl) added support for embedding Bokeh
content in JupyterLab notebooks by creating a new
``jupyterlab_bokeh`` extension. You can install the extension by running

```sh
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_bokeh
```

From your command line.

Here's a screen cap of Bokeh+JLab in action:

The extension supports standalone plots and embedded Bokeh server applications.
Updating plots via ``bokeh.io.push_notebook`` is not yet supported in
JupyterLab, but will be soon. You can follow progress towards getting this
feature working at issue
[``#6619``](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6919).

#### Efficient Binary Transport for Arrays

The Bokeh protocol has iterated and improved over the years. In the beginning, Bokeh's
approach was simply to "JSON all the things". This was OK to start but quickly ran into
performance issues when dealing with things like RGBA image data. Last year a Base64
encoding option was added for arrays, which offered a significant improvement. But
the eventual goal has always been to offer a pure binary transport option for arrays
when possible. I am happy to say that this long standing planned feature has been
implemented.

Below are two examples that would have been out of reach before this release:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">
<img src="/images/release-0-12-9/image.gif">
<img src="/images/release-0-12-9/numba.gif">
</div>

The left example is a 1024x1024 RGBA image with a slider to scrub the value
of its green channel interactively. The right example is a 512x512 scalar
image (colormapped in browser) that is blurred using Numba code in response to the
slider. In case you were wondering, a fast, interactive image processing web app is
about twenty five lines of pure python:

```python
image = scipy.misc.ascent().astype(np.int32)[::-1, :]
w, h = image.shape

source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(image=[image]))

p = figure(x_range=(0, w), y_range=(0, h))
p.image('image', x=0, y=0, dw=w, dh=h, palette=gray(256), source=source)

@njit
def blur(outimage, image, amt):
    for i in range(amt, w-amt):
        for j in range(amt, h-amt):
            px = 0.
            for iw in range(-amt//2, amt//2):
                for jh in range(-amt//2, amt//2):
                    px += image[i+iw, j+jh]
            outimage[i, j] = px/(amt*amt)

def update(attr, old, new):
    out = image.copy()
    blur(out, image, 2*new + 1)
    source.data.update(image=[out])

slider = Slider(title="Blur Factor", start=0, end=10, value=0)
slider.on_change('value', update)

curdoc().add_root(column(p, slider))
```

That's ***it!***

#### Some Release Notes

In order to make some improvements for the long term, a few small, immediate
breaking changes were unavoidable. It is not expected they will affect many users, but
please consult the
[Release Notes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.9/docs/releases/0.12.9.html)
carefully.

As of this Release, Python 3.4 support is no longer maintained under test. Python 2.7
and 3.5+ are the officially supported versions. It is very likely that Bokeh will
continue to function as expected with Python 3.4 but we no longer run the
continuous testing suite against it.

Lastly, a ***very loud warning*** has been added to ``session.loop_until_closed``. It was
never the intention that using ``bokeh.client`` to run application code outside a
Bokeh server be considered a "real" way to do anything. However, mentioning this on the
mailing list and Stack Overflow has not been sufficiently discouraging. The new warning
outlines the many drawbacks of using ``bokeh.client`` in this way.
To drive the point home *all ``models/server`` and ``plotting/server`` examples will be* ***removed from GitHub*** after this release.

#### Next Steps

The only "must-do" task left for 1.0 is to port BokehJS
to TypeScript. Once that is complete, we will immediately
plan 1.0 to be the next release. There are some additional
"nice-to-have" tasks that may go into 1.0, if time and resources permit:

* Scriptable animations and transitions
* New events for document init, busy/done, etc.
* Support "Patches with holes" for GIS usage
* Publish BokehJS reference documentation

In order to avoid the overhead and risk of "big releases", we plan to have more,
smaller releases until 1.0 is ready.

As we get closer to a Bokeh 1.0 release, I'd like to thank the [250
total contributors](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/graphs/contributors) who
have helped make Bokeh such an amazing project. As always, for technical questions
or assistance, please post to the
[Bokeh Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/#!forum/bokeh)
