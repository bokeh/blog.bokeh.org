The Bokeh blog has moved to [Medium.com](https://medium.com/bokeh)! This move allows the Bokeh team  to take advantage of the platform's robust editor and reach a wider audience. By letting Medium be great at the technical side of hosting our blog, the Bokeh team can focus on building and maintaining a great data visualization library.

Future posts can be found at www.medium.com/bokeh. Follow us there to keep up to date on releases, new features, and the ongoing evolution of Bokeh.
